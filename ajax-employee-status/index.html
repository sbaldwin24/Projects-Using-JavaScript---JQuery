          <h2>Huey Lewis and the News</h2>
          <p>Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really
            came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen
            of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello,
            but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.</p>
          <p>Why are there copies of the style section all over the place, d-do you have a dog? A little chow or something?</p>
          <p>Yes it is! In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece
            is "Hip to be Square", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because
            it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement
            about the band itself.</p>
